# Week 2 Project - by Emiliano Nava

The player will have to find their way around the level by following the lights found on the sides of the platforms that will turn on when the player approaches them, avoid the obstacles found throughout the level and reach the end, found under the green spotlight. Each coloured light has its meaning:
-	White: Do not cross – player will fall into the void
-	Blue: Jump – there is a gap ahead
-	Purple: Be careful – the platform ahead disappears
-	Red: obstacles
-	Orange: A cube must be carried under this light
-	Pink: This light will teleport you
